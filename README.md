# Housing-Prices-Prediction
# Housing Price Regression Project

This project demonstrates how to build a regression model to predict housing prices using Python and scikit-learn. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions on new data.

## Features

- Loads and explores a housing dataset
- Preprocesses data and scales features
- Trains a Linear Regression model
- Evaluates model performance with MSE, RMSE, and MAE
- Makes predictions on new, unseen house data

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
